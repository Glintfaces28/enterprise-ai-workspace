Long-Term Modules

Module 1:
Backend Foundation

Module 2:
Database (PostgreSQL)

Module 3:
Authentication (JWT)

Module 4:
Document Upload

Module 5:
AI Document Search & Chat

Status:
Started on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Added authenticated AI document search and chat API endpoints.
Verified the changed Python files with `py_compile`.

Files created:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/services/document_search.py`

This file searches uploaded PDF document content by splitting extracted text into passages and ranking those passages against the user's query.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/routers/ai.py`

This file exposes `/ai/search` and `/ai/chat` endpoints while keeping AI-related HTTP logic separate from document upload logic.

Files updated:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/schemas.py`

This file now includes Pydantic models for search results and chat requests/responses. Chat requests validate the question and limit how many source passages can be returned.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/main.py`

This file now registers the AI router with the FastAPI app.

Frontend:
React Dashboard

Status:
Completed on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Built a complete React frontend connected to the FastAPI backend. Passes npm run build with zero errors.

Files created (enterprise-ai-workspace/frontend/):
- `src/api/client.js` — Axios instance with JWT interceptors
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` — auth state in React Context + localStorage
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` — redirect unauthenticated users
- `src/components/Layout.jsx` — responsive sidebar, mobile hamburger menu
- `src/pages/Login.jsx` — login form with React Hook Form
- `src/pages/Register.jsx` — registration form with auto-login
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — stat cards + quick actions from /reports/summary
- `src/pages/Documents.jsx` — drag-and-drop upload, list, download, delete
- `src/pages/AiChat.jsx` — scrolling chat UI with source citations
- `src/pages/Teams.jsx` — create teams, add/remove members, delete
- `src/pages/Analytics.jsx` — metrics + per-user inline bar chart

Backend change:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/main.py` — CORS middleware added for localhost:5173

Module 6:
Teams & Permissions

Status:
Completed on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Added Team and TeamMember database models and all team management API endpoints.
Verified the changed Python files with `py_compile`.

Files created:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/routers/teams.py`

This file exposes team management endpoints while keeping team HTTP logic separate from other routers.

Files updated:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/models.py`

This file now includes the `Team` model (name, description, owner) and the `TeamMember` model (team_id, user_id, role).

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/schemas.py`

This file now includes Pydantic models for creating teams, returning team data, adding members, and returning member data.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/main.py`

This file now registers the teams router with the FastAPI app.

Module 7:
Reports & Analytics

Status:
Completed on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Added uploaded_by FK to the Document model, updated the upload endpoint to record the uploader, and added workspace analytics API endpoints.
Verified the changed Python files with `py_compile`.

Files created:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/routers/reports.py`

This file exposes `/reports/summary` and `/reports/documents/by-user` endpoints for workspace analytics.

Files updated:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/models.py`

The `Document` model now has an `uploaded_by` column (FK to `users.id`, nullable) so each document is linked to the user who uploaded it.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/routers/documents.py`

The upload endpoint now stores `uploaded_by=current_user.id` when saving a new document.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/schemas.py`

This file now includes `WorkspaceSummary` and `UserUploadStats` Pydantic models for report responses.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/main.py`

This file now registers the reports router with the FastAPI app.

Module 8:
Docker

Status:
Completed on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Containerised the FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL database using Docker and Docker Compose.

Files created:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/Dockerfile`

Builds the FastAPI backend image from python:3.13-slim, installs dependencies, copies source code, and starts uvicorn.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/docker-compose.yml`

Defines two services: `db` (PostgreSQL 16) and `backend` (the FastAPI image). The backend waits for the database to pass a healthcheck before starting.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/.dockerignore`

Excludes venv, __pycache__, .env, and the uploads folder from the Docker image.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/.env.example`

A safe placeholder version of .env with no real secrets. Safe to commit to GitHub.

Module 9:
AWS Deployment

Status:
Completed on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Created all AWS deployment files for running the backend on EC2 with an RDS PostgreSQL database.

Files created:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/docker-compose.prod.yml`

Production compose file. Runs only the backend service — no local database. The database connection points to RDS via the .env file on the EC2 instance.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/aws/ec2-setup.sh`

Bootstrap script to run once on a fresh Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance. Installs Docker, Git, and the Docker Compose plugin.

`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/aws/deploy.sh`

Deployment script. Pulls the latest code from Git, rebuilds the Docker image, and restarts the backend container.

Files updated:
`enterprise-ai-workspace/backend/.dockerignore`

Added `aws/` so the deployment scripts are not baked into the Docker image.

Module 10:
Production Release

Status:
Completed on 25.06.2026.

Completed:
Created .gitignore, README.md, initialised the git repository, and committed all 25 project files.

Files created:
`.gitignore`

Excludes venv, .env, __pycache__, uploads, and OS files from version control.

`README.md`

Professional project documentation covering tech stack, features, project structure, local setup, Docker instructions, AWS deployment steps, and full API endpoint reference.

Actions taken:
`git init` — initialised the git repository at the project root.

`git add` + `git commit` — committed all 25 project files as the initial commit (hash 33790a7).
